# Network Security Analysis & Tools Project
A collection of Python scripts and tools designed for network analysis, vulnerability scanning, and security auditing. This project demonstrates fundamental cybersecurity concepts and practical implementation of network programming.

# Project Overview
This repository contains hands-on implementations of various network security tools. The goal is to understand how common network attacks and defenses work at a packet level, and to build practical skills in Python for cybersecurity.

# Tools & Scripts
1. TCP Handshake Analysis
    Concept: TCP/IP Protocol Analysis & Network Reconnaissance
    
    Technique: Demonstrates the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and various scanning techniques
    
    Key Skills:
    
    Raw socket programming
    
    TCP flag manipulation (SYN, ACK, RST)
    
    Port state detection (Open/Closed/Filtered)
    
    Network reconnaissance methodology

2. ARP Spoofer / Man-in-the-Middle
    Concept: Layer 2 Attack & Network Interception
    
    Technique: Implements ARP cache poisoning to redirect traffic through an attacker's machine
    
    Key Skills:
    
    ARP protocol manipulation
    
    Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack implementation
    
    Network traffic interception

    Protocol analysis (HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP)
    
    Credential harvesting from unencrypted traffic
    
    Network forensics fundamentals

4. Custom Port Scanner
    Concept: Service Enumeration & Network Mapping
    
    Technique: Multiple scanning methods including TCP SYN, Connect, and UDP scanning
    
    Key Skills:
    
    Network reconnaissance
    
    Service discovery
    
    Banner grabbing
    
    Multithreading for performance
