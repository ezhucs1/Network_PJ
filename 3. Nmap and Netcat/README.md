# Find and Send 

Use nmap command to find the remote host on the 10.0.0.0/24 
network. Once you have discovered the remote host and which port is open. 
Then connect to the IP and Port using netcat.

===== Welcome to Intercepting Communication! =====
In this series of challenges, you will be working within a virtual network in order to intercept networked traffic.
In this challenge you will find and connect to a remote host.
The remote host is somewhere on the `10.0.0.0/24` subnetwork, listening on port `9387`.

Note: the IP addr and MAC addr are randomly generated, this excerce is practiced under protected and safe enviorment
