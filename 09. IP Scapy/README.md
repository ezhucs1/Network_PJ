## IP Scapy 

In this challenge, you will create and send an IP packet using scapy. Configure scapy to send the packet to 10.0.248.251 @ ab:3b:cc:ee:2b:4f. The packet must set proto=0xFF

===== Welcome to Intercepting Communication! =====
In this series of challenges, you will be working within a virtual network in order to intercept networked traffic.
In this challenge you will manually send an Internet Protocol packet.
The packet should have `IP proto=0xFF`.
The packet should be sent to the remote host at `10.0.248.251`  @ `ab:3b:cc:ee:2b:4f`.

Note: the IP addr and MAC addr are randomly generated, this excerce is practiced under protected and safe enviorment
